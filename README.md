A modern, responsive web interface to simulate monitoring and managing firewall policies. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this frontend prototype mimics how a firewall management dashboard could look and behave.

-  Enable/Disable **TCP and UDP blocking**
-  View **request summaries** (Accepted, Denied, All)
-  Explore firewall features:
  - Application-level firewall
  - Domain & IP blocking
  - Network usage monitoring
-  Responsive and accessible layout
-  Dark-themed UI for a sleek experience
